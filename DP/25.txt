1. You are given a number M representing length of highway(range).
2. You are given a number N representing number of bill boards.
3. You are given N space separated numbers representing (P)position of bill-boards.
4. You are given N space separated numbers representing (R)revenue corresponding to each (P)position.
5. You are given a number T such that bill-boards can only be placed after specific distance(T).
6. Find the maximum revenue that can be generated.
